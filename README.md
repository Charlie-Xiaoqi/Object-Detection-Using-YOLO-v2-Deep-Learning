# Object Detection Example using Yolo v2 Deep Learning

This demo shows the full deep learning workflow for an example of image data. We show how to prepare, model, and deploy a deep learning based object detection algorithm to identify vehicles of interest in a scene.

For more details, please refer to the documentation article [Getting Started with YOLO v2.](https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ug/getting-started-with-yolo-v2.html)

This demo is implemented as a MATLAB project and will require you to open the project to run it. The project will manage all paths and shortcuts you need. There is also a significant data copy required the first time you run the project.
